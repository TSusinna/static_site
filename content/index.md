## About me

  **Regarding development**, from a very young age I was passionate about the idea of automating tasks with technology, as well as any advancements in artificial intelligence. I started studying JavaScript but ended up fascinated by Python and everything it can do. I have a solid foundation in this language and I’m currently learning data structures, NumPy and Pandas to upload more personal projects. I maintain JavaScript Knowledge and usually operate using a Linux terminal for convenience. After this stage, I want to delve into the field of AI.

  **As for administrative tasks**, it’s something I’m very good at given my organized and fast-paced nature in digital environments. I manage my finances, accounts and tasks using Google Sheets and I literally enjoy doing it. I feel the app is an extension of myself. I’m good at meeting deadlines and have the ability to multitask without losing control.
