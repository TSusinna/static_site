#### **Computer Programming** at San Martín National University

_March 2023 - Current day_

I started studying there to pursue a degree while I study with courses and personal projects as I see them as a faster way of achieving my objectives.

#### **Animation** at Image Campus

_March 2018 - September 2019_

**I decided to quit** studying animation after I tried coding for the first time, I found what I wanted to do so I decided to change my career. The good thing is that I've acquired some basic Adobe Photoshop knowledge, along with some of the bases for animation, character design, 3D modelling and textures.

#### **Arts High School** at José Hernández School

_Graduated in 2017_
