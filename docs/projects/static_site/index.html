        <div><h1>Static Site Generator</h1><p><a href="..">< Back to projects</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/TSusinna/static_site">GitHub Repository</a></p><ul><li>Current version: 2.6</li></ul><ul><li>Python, CSS, HTML</li></ul><h3>About it</h3><p>You're looking at it right now! This entire page was made with markdown, then converted using this generator. It wasn't easy to finish it as I faced a lot of errors and made hundreds of tests (you can actually look at some of them in the files). You just write in markdown what you want, put in in the content directory, run build.sh then main.sh. Make sure you have Flask installed or host it on a live server.</p><p>If you just want to take a look, go see the content directory and you'll find the markdown files, then in the static directory you'll have images and CSS. Then go to the docs directory and you'll see the same files all converted just as you see them in the page.</p></div>
